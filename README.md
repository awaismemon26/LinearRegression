# Linear Regression Model
### Simple Multivariable Linear Model using Scikit Learn Library
----
1. **Imported Dataset**
2. **Seperated Features and Labels** (Finding Dependent and Independent Variables)
    - Dependent variable should be Vector
    - Independent variable should be Matrix
3. **Splitting Data into Training and Test Sets**
4. **Feature Scaling** -- Optional
    - Standardization using StandardScaler Class) 
5. **Training Linear Mode** (On Training Set)
6. **Optimal Coefficients** 
    - Model has to find the most optimal coeffients for all the attributes. 
7. **Prediction**
